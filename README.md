# Block Fall
A simple pixi.js web game I made over a few days, to prove to myself that I'm capable of finishing projects when I don't scope-creep ad infinitum. Has a bunch of unused code due to me reusing code from another project ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

Font used is [m5x7 by Daniel Linssen](https://managore.itch.io/m5x7).

Available on [github pages](http://cursedflames.github.io/BlockFallGame/index.html), or, to run it yourself:

Installation: `npm install`

Compilation: `gulp`

Depending on your browser, opening index.html directly might not work, due to failing to load resources; you'll need a localhost server instead. I recommend [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) as a simple server.
